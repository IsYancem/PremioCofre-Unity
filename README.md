# PremioCofre-Unity

Brief project description.

## Game Idea
The game is a side-scrolling game where the player character (Jogador) can move left or right and jump. The objective of the game is to collect coins scattered throughout the level. When enough coins are collected, a chest is unlocked, and a victory screen is displayed.

## Game Proposal
The game proposes a challenge of skill and reflexes. The player must control the character (Jogador) to move and jump, avoiding obstacles and collecting coins. The game has a limit of three coins in the level at any given time, and each time a coin is collected, a new coin is generated at a random location. Once the player has collected enough coins (currently set to 200 points), the victory screen is displayed, and the chest opens.
